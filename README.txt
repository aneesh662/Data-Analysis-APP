Data Analysis and Visualization Streamlit App

Overview

This project is a Streamlit application designed for data analysis and visualization. Users can upload their own Excel datasets, and the app provides interactive charts and summary statistics to help analyze the data. The app supports visualizations such as trends over time, daily comparisons of revenue, expense, and profit, and distribution of financial metrics.

Features

File Upload: Users can upload Excel files containing their data.
Data Display: Displays the uploaded dataset in a user-friendly table format.
Summary Statistics: Provides basic descriptive statistics of the dataset.

Visualizations:
Trends Over Time: Line plots for revenue, expense, and profit.
Daily Comparison: Bar charts comparing revenue, expense, and profit for each day.
Distribution: Pie chart showing the distribution of total revenue, expense, and profit.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Streamlit: Framework for building the web application.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for creating visualizations.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or later
Required Python packages: streamlit, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Dataset Format
The dataset for the Data Analysis and Visualization Streamlit App should be in Excel format (.xlsx) and must contain the following columns:

Date

Description: The date of the record. This column should be in a recognizable date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
Example Value: 2024-01-15
Description

Description: A textual description or label associated with the record. This could represent the type of transaction or any other relevant information.
Example Value: Sale, Expense, Purchase
Revenue

Description: The amount of revenue generated for the given date. This should be numeric and represent monetary values.
Example Value: 1500.00
Expense

Description: The amount of expense incurred for the given date. This should be numeric and represent monetary values.
Example Value: 500.00
Profit

Description: The profit for the given date, calculated as Revenue - Expense. This should be numeric and represent monetary values.
Example Value: 1000.00
Example Dataset
Hereâ€™s a sample dataset to illustrate the required format:

Date	Description	Revenue	Expense	Profit
2024-01-01	Sale	2000.00	300.00	1700.00
2024-01-02	Purchase	0.00	100.00	-100.00
2024-01-03	Sale	1500.00	200.00	1300.00
2024-01-04	Expense	0.00	50.00	-50.00
2024-01-05	Sale	1800.00	250.00	1550.00
Important Notes
Date Column: Ensure that the date column is in a proper date format that can be parsed by pandas. Incorrect or unrecognized date formats may lead to errors in analysis.
Numeric Columns: Revenue, Expense, and Profit should be numeric values. Non-numeric values in these columns may cause errors in calculations and visualizations.
Handling Missing Data: The app is designed to handle missing values in the dataset. However, it's good practice to ensure that the dataset is complete and accurate before uploading.
